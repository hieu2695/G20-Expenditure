            <h3>Amount of Expenditure</h3>
            <p> This part presents the expenditure of 19 countries on military, healthcare, education per year. As was discussed in the Overview, United States is the biggest spender in all three categories every year.</p>

                <div id='col_spend_control_div' class='filter_class'></div>

            <h3>Expenditure as Share of GDP</h3>
            <p> The share of GDP describes how a nation prioritizes their spending, which helps to explain the investment strategy and policy of a government each year.</p>
             <div id='col_share_dashboard_div'>
                <div id='col_share_control_div' class='filter_class'></div>
                <div id='col_share_chart_div'></div>
            </div>
            </br>
            <p> Although United States is the biggest spender in the absolute amount, their expenditures as share of GDP are not relatively high to other countries. During 2011-2013, countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom have similar or higher share of GDP than United States in healthcare spending. From 2014, the investment of United States on healthcare starts growing and surpasses other countries.</br></br>
                Saudi Arabia is the country with highest share of GDP in military spending. The amount is maintained at around 10% of their total GDP. Although China is the second largest spender in military, their share of GDP is approximately 2% every year. This explains their policies in connecting military with economic growth. The same strategy is also applied for their healthcare expenditure.
            </p>
            </br>
            <h3>Expenditure per Capita</h3>
            <p> The expenditure per capita points out the average spending of each resident per year. This gives a general knowledge of a nation's wealthy and growth.</p>
            <div id='col_spend_capita_dashboard_div'>
                <div id='col_spend_capita_control_div' class='filter_class'></div>
                <div id='col_spend_capita_chart_div' class='chart_class'></div>
            </div>
            </br>
            <p> The expenditure per capita has the similar chart as share of GDP. The country with the highest per person spending in military is Saudi Arabia. United States, Australia and Europe nations such as France, Germany and United Kingdom have highest educational expenditure per capita. It is estimated from the chart that residents in the United States have the highest average spending in healthcare. Their per person healthcare expenditure in 2016 rose by two times the amount in 2011 (from $4,000 to $8,000 per capita).</p>
