## Topic: Domestic Government Expenditure of G20 countries.

---
### Introduction

This is an analysis about the expenditure of 19 countries in G20 (excluding Europe Union) on three categories: military, healthcare and education during 2011-2016. 

With the use of visual studio code, this project provides visualizations for the spending data to help identify the patterns and trending in the expenditure of different countries. The results are expected to help governments and their citizens to be aware of the policies and priorities of their countries over the time.

### About the Data

The dataset is retrieved from [Data World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). 

In this project, only the domestic general government expenditures are taken into consideration. The data is preprocessed using Python and is visualized using Visual Studio Code. Due to the availability of data, there are some missing values in education expenditure so the analysis of education is not completely meaningful.

### Key Findings

There are some key findings to be concluded from this project:
* United States is the biggest spender in military, healthcare and education. The nation spends a lot of financial investment in all three categories. However, United States shows an increasing policy in healthcare facilities, whereas the country gradually reduces the support for military.
* Although United States is the biggest spender, the fastest growing countries in military are Saudi Arabia and China. While China has the highest growth in the absolute amount, Saudi Arabia is the country with the highest percentage change.
* From an economic view, most of the governments maintain a consistent policy for their expenditures in regards to the economic growth. The most noteworthy findings are the priority of United States in healthcare and the priority of Russia in military.
